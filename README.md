Please find attached the R Script I used to produce all of the 'Townscapes' reports for the Bennett Institue for Public Polcy, Cambridge University.
Apologies for the sloppy labelling, please contact me on twitter/email etc. if you are interested an want to know more.
Also apologies undoubted errors - I'm relatively new to this!
