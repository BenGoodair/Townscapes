# Townscapes 
Please find attached the R Script I used to produce all of the 'Townscapes' reports for the Bennett Institue for Public Polcy, Cambridge University.

Apologies for the sloppy labelling, please contact me on twitter/email etc. if you are interested and confused. 

Also all data behind them is public access so I'd be happy to send any underlying data.

:)
